## Usage Instructions
- Password shared by all preset accounts: `password`

- It is possible to register a new user or use a pre-existing one. For new users, make sure the matricola (e.g. s111111) is the same as the one specified in the email address (e.g. s111111@stuenti.polito.it). New accounts should be confirmed by clicking on the link received via email. To avoid sending unsolicited email, all messages are redirected to the same address they are sent from (`virtuallabs.notfier@gmail.com`). You can ask us for having your account confirmed or you can make the appropriate changes directly in the DB.
